    "it.",
    "I want to show you three ways I use it that are not exactly for doing presentations.",
    "The first one is that you can ask it about any topic and it will create a draft of a",
    "presentation for you and present the topic to you.",

    "videos.",
    "I will actually demo this afterwards, how it really looks, but here I just want to show",

    "Then you will have a second screen where you can add additional details.",

    "the techniques, introduction, introduction to this, and so on and so on.",
    "We have key techniques, effective storytelling, and so on and so on.",
    "You get this kind of like infographical template.",
    "Pretty nice.",
    "So another use case I use it for sometimes, for fun, is visualizing articles.",
    "For example, here is an article from Attila Vagal at Prezi Engineering blog about the",
    "value of experimentation in software development.",
    "Now it's not a very big article.",
    "It's well-formatted, still not small either.",
    "So what you can do is you can paste the text into Prezi i and you would get a template",
    "like this, giving you an introduction to it.",
    "Like curiosity of software engineers, the urge to experiment, concept of golden days,",

    "This is how we call when a person uses presentation format for his resume, kind of like a visual",
    "thing.",
    "So what you can do is you can go to a LinkedIn, you can copy your work history, your education,",
    "your about section, and so on and so on.",
    "Copy this text into Prezi, yeah, assistant, and get a presentation like this.",
    "So yeah, there was throughsga, Prezi resume.",
    "Here is my background.",
    "Here is passion and growth, current role at Prezi, my technical expertise, and so on and",
    "so on.",
    "So pretty fun, right?",
    "Considering it takes only around a minute.",

    "Depends if we can find something good.",

    "You can update the prompt, add more information or jump into the editing and change something",
    "you don't like and your visuals.",

    "For example, let's say that you need to do a presentation in a week and now you need",
    "to sit down and think of things and you have nothing.",

    "draft.",

    "phrases.",
    "For example, here it gives me title, for a slide, it gives me speaker notes, but it",
    "gives me speaker notes as an instruction.",
    "I usually dislike that, I usually prefer to give it enough content and ask it to give",
    "me actual speech text.",

    "How do you support what you are saying with visuals?",
    "What kind of visuals would work?",
    "Pretty nice.",
    "Anyways, it didn't give me actual speech, so I needed in this case to prompt it again",
    "like give me actual speech based on materials I gave you.",
    "And it did deliver some fun stuff.",
    "For example, I really like the first line here.",
    "Imagine a world where your ideas flow seamlessly onto the canvas, where the doubting task of",

    "As we stand on the brink of a new era in presentation design, Prezii Assistant emerges as our guide.",
    "Then it has something I would not use.",
    "It's a companion and creativity that understands our needs and translating them into visually",
    "stunning narratives.",
    "From choosing templates to matching colors, it crafts stories that are uniquely ours.",
    "Yeah, I really love this thing, especially last part.",
    "It crafts stories that are uniquely ours.",
    "That's a good phrase.",
    "I would use that.",
    "So I would not use maybe half of it, but the structure is good ideas, good reasons for",
    "why it's structured exactly this way.",
    "It's good and you can iterate with it so that it flows the way you want, so that it uses",
    "words that are closer to yours.",
    "So let's actually take a look at what works.",
    "Write me some content on the PowerPoint.",
    "Compare to Prezii.",
    "Then structure presentation out of it.",
    "Then structure presentation out of it.",
    "Okay.",

    "presentation strategies outlined in your materials, such as the importance of engaging",
    "storytelling, emotional resonance and clear structure.",
    "Nice.",
    "Opening, the art of presentation, choosing your canvas.",
    "Yeah, nice.",

    "Okay.",
    "Begin with a story about a memorable presentation that captivated you, emphasized the power",
    "of storytelling and visuals in presentation, setting the stage for comparing PowerPoint",
    "and Prezii.",
    "PowerPoint, the classic tool.",
    "Visual idea, a screenshot of a presentation, PowerPoint, speaker note, introduced PowerPoint",
    "as a longstanding familiar tool, dynamic approach.",
    "Okay, let's ask it separately.",
    "Okay.",
    "Now write me the speech itself.",
    "So I can practice.",
    "Okay, so what do we have here?",
    "It speaks about user interface, ease of use, design, visual ideas, head-by-head comparison,",
    "PowerPoint and Prezii, compare the user interfaces, discuss the learning curve, so we wonder, so",
    "opening.",
    "Imagine stepping in the room.",
    "The lights are dead.",
    "And the story unfolds before your eyes, not through the words alone, but through a symphony",

    "That's the power of great presentation.",
    "Today we are diving in the world of PowerPoint and Prezii, two masters of storytelling, to",
    "help you choose the canvas for your next masterpiece.",
    "Again, nice, right?",
    "It's not bad, considering we just did it in a minute.",
    "So would one use this as is?",
    "Don't know.",
    "In my case, I adapted because it's hard to remember not your own phrases, but it has",
    "some good ideas, good structure.",
    "It gets you started quickly.",
    "Okay, let's go back to presentation.",
    "So okay, this is the step that I do to create a draft."
  ],
  "19:22": [
    "But why do I start with a draft?",
    "It has to do with time.",
    "Because when I was presenting this presentation at work, I only had 10 minutes.",
    "I'm already used more than 10 minutes now in this video, because I'm also showing demos,",
    "which I didn't.",
    "Still, I start with a draft because it allows me to measure how much time it's going to",
    "take.",
    "And this is important because I didn't yet invest time into making visuals.",
    "If I start with visuals, then, and find out that I need to do it smaller, I will have",
    "way more work before me.",
    "So first, I ensure in a draft that I like what I will be speaking about, that I like",
    "the structure, and they fit in time.",
    "So how do you ensure with draft that I fit in time?",
    "Well, I use a technique where I'm using average words per minute counts.",
    "Because usually humans speak with around 150 words per minute.",
    "Right?",
    "And which means that, let's say, for a presentation of 10 minutes, it will be something like",
    "1500 words.",
    "So if my speech is 1500 words, I'm probably cutting it to close.",
    "And there is one more thing.",
    "So usually, they advise you to record how you speak, then count the words, and then you",
    "know how many you speak.",
    "Because you could be speaking faster, there are people who speak like 200 words a minute.",
    "When they are excited and they are presenting and so on.",
    "There are people who are nervous or just like they have different mood or something and",
    "they speak slower and it could be like as low as 100.",
    "So you need to understand what kind of presenter you are.",
    "Now in my case, I was more tricky.",
    "Because I actually didn't count myself.",
    "There are today a lot of tools that can transcribe an audio.",
    "And I also just didn't just record my audio.",
    "I actually used the recording of a presentation I gave a year ago to see how fast I actually",
    "speak in actual real presentation in a real setting.",
    "So if you can do something like that, that could help you.",
    "So yeah, you give it an audio to a tool like this.",
    "The tool is based on Whisper.",
    "It's an open source model from OpenAI that transcribes audio pretty well, especially",
    "in English.",
    "But it's pretty good in other languages too.",
    "This one is for Mac.",
    "There are similar tools for Windows.",
    "There are some online, some are free, some are not.",
    "This is free for certain sizes and qualities.",
    "So I gave it an audio from last year.",
    "It gave me a transcript.",
    "And I also have on a code pen a tool where I can paste a transcript.",
    "And it gives me a chart.",
    "It groups all the words from the transcript.",
    "And it gives me word counts per minute.",
    "So for a presentation I was giving a year ago, that was around like 14 minutes in length.",
    "On the first minute I was speaking 120 words per minute.",
    "So slower than average.",
    "On minute number five I only was speaking 100.",
    "This is because I actually was not speaking.",
    "I was actually showing a small video there.",
    "And then on minute six I went to 160.",
    "But still, on average in my case it's more like 130, maybe 120.",
    "Especially because I'm also showing and not only talking.",
    "So this is the way I learned that for me it's probably 130.",
    "Then you can take a speech.",
    "You can paste it in a lot of tools and lines that count number of words.",
    "And you can see that for this speech that I gave me there was 481 words.",
    "And if I have 10 minutes and 130 words per minute is my speed, then for me I would have",
    "something like 1300 words worth of text I can speak.",
    "So 481 is pretty nice.",
    "Still my presentation did blow up a bit while I was editing later.",
    "Usually you need to be very strict and stay to the script if you want to actually fit.",
    "In my case in rehearsal it was more like 15 minutes.",
    "But afterwards I adjusted, cut out some parts and got it under, I think it was 9 minutes",
    "and 30 seconds.",
    "My delivery.",
    "Anyways, let's actually try to demo this.",
    "So here is the tool.",
    "I will actually put a lot of links in the description.",
    "So for most of the things you hear, find it in the description.",
    "Or if you don't find something, ask me in comments.",
    "I will give you links.",
    "Okay, so here it is.",
    "And here I already opened before my audio from a year ago.",
    "We can actually open this or you can open a file.",
    "But now it's actually transcribing.",
    "And you can see it's transcribing and transcribing and transcribing.",
    "So for now it transcribes something like, yeah, it's actually already did pretty fast.",
    "It already did 90%.",
    "And done.",
    "Okay, so now we can export this.",
    "My tool on CodePen versus SRT file.",
    "So I need SRT and I can export.",
    "Let's export.",
    "Yeah, let's replace.",
    "Okay, now we can go to CodePen.",
    "I will share the link too.",
    "And I actually need to open the file.",
    "Give me a sec.",
    "Oops.",
    "I want to open with text editor.",
    "Yay, here it is.",
    "So here is a speech that I gave, a speech from the text from a presentation that I gave",
    "a year ago.",
    "Paste it here.",
    "And you can see here is a chart.",
    "Here is actually the whole text for this part.",
    "Right?",
    "And we can see 120 words on first minute, 100 on the fifth minute, and so on and so on.",
    "So this is how I check if I'm fitting into a time slot.",
    "Okay, let's go.",
    "We have a couple of more topics to visit.",
    "Okay, so now we know that we fit into a time slot."
  ],
  "26:41": [
    "Now I would want to speak about visuals, but before we do that, I want to speak a little",
    "bit about user attention and speaker notes, because the way I think about those influence",
    "how I usually try to do visuals.",
    "So user attention.",
    "One thing I learned over the years of working crazy is that when we present or even communicate,",
    "especially when it's one to many, like I have a monologue where I'm speaking to a lot of",
    "people like you guys on YouTube or I'm giving a public presentation, the main thing we are",
    "working with is attention.",
    "And attention is like a muscle.",
    "You can strain it.",
    "You can waste its energy.",
    "You can use it in a way where it will go numb.",
    "Okay?",
    "It's like a muscle.",
    "So if you're doing it wrong, you will lose attention of the users.",
    "And one example of how to lose it is to show users too much things at the same time.",
    "For example, like this.",
    "I'm showing too many things at the same time.",
    "Do you?",
    "And what happens at this point is that users will switch their attention from you, from",
    "what you're speaking, to check out what you showed them.",
    "And if there is too much, it will require their full attention and they will stop listening.",
    "This is not what you want to do.",
    "In reality, your visuals only need to support what you're saying.",
    "Usually it's better to show them one by one, because showing them like this is a distraction."
  ],
  "28:16": [
    "And showing things one by one actually has an additional bonus, secondary bonus.",
    "Because I'm actually in presentations, I'm not using speaker notes.",
    "Instead, what I do is that I show things one by one and when I rehearse or when I'm doing",
    "a presentation, I usually add one visual animation per one topic I want to speak about.",
    "So that I need to click through it and then it reminds me of what I want to speak about",
    "next.",
    "I click, things show up and I remember, oh, I wanted to speak about speech and visuals,",
    "that they are in sync when I do it this way.",
    "So this way, I click, visual shows up, it gets attention of a user, reminds me what",
    "I want to speak about and I speak about it and it happens sync in sync.",
    "Visual support my speech, my speech supports my visuals.",
    "I think this is the best way to do it.",
    "Now, in this presentation, it's not perfect, it was an experimental presentation and it's",
    "not perfect with all of these visuals because they are too busy.",
    "It's better that they are focused.",
    "It's better that you show only one thing at a time.",
    "You only show more than one thing to show context, relationship, comparisons.",
    "Otherwise, speak about one thing and also try to minimize animations.",
    "And it's not only about animations.",
    "Actually for example, what I hate about PowerPoint in times is that you click a button, a whole",
    "slide switches, a lot of visuals, everything changed.",
    "There is a lot of things to watch and a lot of people put a lot of text, a lot of visuals",
    "on one slide and show them all at the same time.",
    "You lose your users attention at this point.",
    "These days, in tools like Prezi or some other tools, I prefer to have very minimal changes,",
    "slowly moving from one thing to the next.",
    "No big slide changes, no lot of things at the same time.",
    "One by one and I even try to fade out things that I'm not speaking about.",
    "Now, in this presentation, I'm not exactly doing it this way, but if you will subscribe,",
    "you will see in the future in some of the presentations that I am doing it this way,",
    "where I'm only trying to focus on one thing at a time.",
    "And I'm trying to do it in context with very small movement and animations and no slide",
    "changes and so on.",
    "Anyways, this is how I try to do my presentations.",
    "To try not to waste your attention."
  ],
  "30:93": [
    "So okay, now we can go to visuals.",
    "So we have a draft, we are happy, we fit into time slot, we know about user attention and",
    "how to do speaker notes, what to do next.",
    "Well, there is pretty nice thingies on, again, Charge-APT+.",
    "Or making visuals for your presentations.",
    "I think it's actually a very powerful thing that you can with AI today, create a picture",
    "that is very focused on exactly what you want to say, exactly the visual that's gonna support",
    "your story.",
    "You still will need to iterate and pick.",
    "And for this, I really love this one, Glebot 3R Designer.",
    "So the way it works is that you give it any text, I gave it here the outline of the presentation.",
    "And what it does is that, like usually for a text, it will give you four ideas of how",
    "to visualize it.",
    "But in this case, when I gave it outline, and when you give it outline in general, it",
    "actually does it a little bit differently.",
    "It actually gives you one idea for slide.",
    "So I gave it slide outline, it will give me one idea for slide number one, one for slide",
    "number two, three and four.",
    "So here I gave it outline, and it gave me a mid-journey prompt.",
    "If you're a mid-journey user, you can go and use it in mid-journey, but it also does a",
    "dali 3 image, which is also nice.",
    "So here the first image it gave me is a digital illustration showcasing the futuristic AI",
    "team background.",
    "Okay.",
    "Then imagine a prompt split-screen composition contrasting a traditional presentation.",
    "This is for the second slide where we are comparing before and after AI.",
    "I would probably work on this more.",
    "Then there is a third.",
    "It's also in different style and fourth again, two of its slides illustrating creative uses",
    "of Prezi AI.",
    "Remember, creative uses of Prezi AI, something we did this presentation.",
    "For slides, it could work if you're using slide product.",
    "Probably one thing I would do is that I would pick one of the four.",
    "Actually I would ask it to do four ideas for each slide.",
    "So I have something to choose from.",
    "Then I would pick one of the pictures as a style and ask it for all further images used",
    "this style.",
    "And then I would probably iterate.",
    "Sometimes I like one of the four, but I want more ideas like it.",
    "Give me four more like this.",
    "My name is today.",
    "We are not using PowerPoint or other slide tools.",
    "We are using Prezi.",
    "And Prezi is a little bit different that instead of using slides, it's using open converse,",
    "where everything is on the converse at the same time.",
    "And instead of switching pages, we are traveling on the open converse kind of like with camera.",
    "It's more cinematic.",
    "So for Prezi, we actually need a template that incorporates it all in one thing.",
    "So I'm actually asking it here like, hey, give me something more like an infographic",
    "map or a mind map that incorporates all of the topics of the outline in one picture.",
    "Let's see what it gives me.",
    "A digital landscape infographic representing an evolutionary storytelling.",
    "Okay, too busy for my taste.",
    "I would probably ask it to simplify.",
    "Same here.",
    "An interactive mind map centered around the core team of storytelling.",
    "And again, too busy.",
    "This one, this one's actually interesting.",
    "I would maybe ask it to simplify, make it less busy, but imagine like you having a presentation",
    "which is a theme park that you travel through as you visit topic after topic after topic.",
    "It's kind of like on a road.",
    "So I would make it less busy, but otherwise interesting.",
    "I would iterate on that.",
    "So I could have picked this, but next one.",
    "This one caught my attention.",
    "A futuristic building with a lot of rooms and I can use each room for one topic.",
    "And that fun.",
    "So you can notice that this is the picture I actually used for this presentation.",
    "As I said, this is presentation about how this presentation was made.",
    "Anyways, this is a picture that Dali would generate for you.",
    "There are some problems.",
    "This text is not good.",
    "But at least in this template, it's easy to remove with some black background.",
    "I can just like paint it over with black and some other image editor, or I could put it",
    "a black rectangle, right in Prezi editor on top and so on and write my own text there.",
    "But there is also second problem that quality is pretty bad.",
    "I mean in Prezi we are zooming in and when we zoom in, we would get that.",
    "Doesn't look good.",
    "So what do we do?",
    "You got an image.",
    "Yeah, actually one more thing is that I actually wanted clocks here.",
    "If you remember in this part, I was speaking about idea traps, drafts, then about I had",
    "clocks on the wall and speaking about time and then speaking about how to measure time",
    "in various tools.",
    "So yeah, okay.",
    "What do you do?",
    "Unusable, right?",
    "Well, that's where other AI tools come in.",
    "For example, one I like to use these days is called Leonardo AI.",
    "It has 150 credits for free per day.",
    "So in my experience, it's something like 30 to 50 images per day or 30 to 50 AI edits",
    "per day, which may not be enough for a presentation, but you could do it over three days and then",
    "it's enough.",
    "I will show you a bit later a live demo how to work with it."
  ],
  "37:02": [
    "Actually about live demos.",
    "We skipped the demonstration of GliBattery.",
    "Yeah, I wanted to show you how that looks.",
    "Right, let's actually jump back.",
    "So here is charge.gbt, here is GliBattery.",
    "We did generate a speech, right?",
    "Let's actually give it to it and see what it does.",
    "Now this is going to be a bit slow.",
    "So here it's writing a mid-journey prompt.",
    "I guess we can ask it not to write it and it will be slightly faster.",
    "Now it's generating the first image.",
    "Something we gave it an outline is going to probably do a 1.31 digital illustration",
    "of a classic structured presentation room played by soft cloth porpoise slideshokies",
    "in detail, it's like via something, something.",
    "What does it say?",
    "Since you're exploring the art of storytelling through PowerPoint and Prezi presentations,",
    "I'll grab four distinct visual representations to capture essence of your narrative.",
    "Each image will embody key aspects of your comparison, focusing on ink features.",
    "Again, I don't know, would you use this one for a presentation as a background, as a template,",
    "put your topics on top?",
    "Maybe.",
    "Interesting, for this outline it feels like it didn't go with generating idea per slide.",
    "Yeah, this one is actually starting to look interesting, right?",
    "You could like put your areas on top, like semi-transparent backgrounds and you have",
    "a couple of topics to speak about and it looks super sexy.",
    "If you're doing something, I don't know, artistic.",
    "Okay, what about the third one?",
    "So yeah, artistic, more serious.",
    "You could paint it over with white.",
    "Zoom in as well, I don't know.",
    "Okay.",
    "This is actually could be a visual on the side.",
    "So this would do for like this two are for the background and something Prezi-like where",
    "you zoom in.",
    "And this one is more like a side image.",
    "I actually kind of love this because basically already just slides with one key phrase and",
    "an image that is exactly on the point is already very powerful storytelling today with where",
    "I can help.",
    "Also kind of nice, but kind of too artistic.",
    "And you can like it actually gives other ideas like you can also try a scene depicting a moment",
    "of inspiration behind a groundbreaking PowerPoint design, an artistic representation of Prezi",
    "presentation, transforming a traditional crafts element interactive learning environment,",
    "a futuristic view of presentation tools, blending elements of PowerPoint and Prezi in a new",
    "internet interface.",
    "Anyway, so let's ask it like do one, two and four.",
    "Let's go back to presentation and leave it to work.",
    "This is one of the styles I actually like to work with AI where, okay, it's long, but",
    "I can go and do other things.",
    "Let it work in the background and we can return later and check results."
  ],
  "40:87": [
    "Anyways, so yeah, editing Leonardo.",
    "So again, this is what I got.",
    "Not good enough quality and no clocks.",
    "Leonardo AI allows actually things called in painting and also image to image.",
    "So we can go take a screenshot of the area we want.",
    "We can edit it, change the objects.",
    "Like for example, here we can erase a picture and ask it to fill with the clock on the wall",
    "in the wooden room.",
    "And it will propose us four variants of what to fill it with.",
    "And we can get something like this, which is not bad, but still kind of low quality.",
    "Leonardo AI allows to upscale too.",
    "And certainly I think it's upscaler is not that good.",
    "This is how it upscaled and I'm actually not sure if it's better.",
    "I think maybe one thing is that here clocks looks better than background and here both",
    "look average.",
    "So anyways, upscaling Leonardo is not very good.",
    "Replacing visuals is not bad.",
    "It's not perfect.",
    "I would like it to be better."
  ],
  "42:29": [
    "But today there is actually another tool that is very impressive and it's magnificent.",
    "Well Leonardo AI has a free tier, Magnificently does not.",
    "It costs $40 a month, but it's actually very good in upscaling images creatively.",
    "Example they have and I can tell you this is actually not fake and I will show you.",
    "We will go into those tools.",
    "But this is a picture, give it and this is what you get out.",
    "Incredible to be honest.",
    "So I actually used it for this presentation and the way it's upscales is more like this.",
    "Now it's still not perfect.",
    "There are some weirdness like I have no idea what the hell is here with the clock.",
    "There is also another interesting thing which is this clock.",
    "If you notice, so this clock is actually sharp all the way in.",
    "Well this is blurred.",
    "What is happening?",
    "Well, this is something interesting that I noticed about how magnificent it was.",
    "Because Magnific tries to preserve the idea of your picture.",
    "If your picture has blue, blue, pixelation, some kind of vector strokes, it will not add",
    "details as you zoom in.",
    "If your picture is something more like a photography, that is crisp, has no blues, blooms or anything,",
    "then actually in theory you can zoom in indefinitely.",
    "But anyways, I took the picture from Dali, I erased things with Leonardo AI and changed",
    "it I didn't like, and then I upscaled with Magnific.",
    "This is how I got this template for this presentation.",
    "But after playing with it, I actually started to get curious, can we actually get an infinite",
    "zoom with Magnific?",
    "And here is where I tried.",
    "I gave it a picture like this.",
    "It's not really a photo, it's still a digital drawing.",
    "And we can see that as we zoom in, it's kind of like a blurry pixelated mess.",
    "But we can take a screenshot and we can upscale.",
    "And suddenly it's way more detailed.",
    "Well maybe way more is overselling it.",
    "But it is more crisp, more detailed.",
    "Still, we can zoom in, we can take a screenshot and we can upscale it again.",
    "And in that again detail, like check out the water.",
    "We can actually take a look at the border.",
    "On the left is a picture before upscale and the right is after.",
    "You can see clearly that it's better.",
    "But not by much, because it's still digital art, it tries to preserve the style, and if",
    "your style is messy, it will be messy.",
    "So actually, one of the Magnific will add some features for denoising, deblurring, deblooming,",
    "I don't know, there needs to be some kind of more artistic control that actually I want",
    "to deblur here or something.",
    "So I don't know.",
    "To answer a question of whether we can zoom indefinitely, sometimes we can.",
    "Often it's very tricky and gets pixelated.",
    "I mean, like I mean, it's pretty, like I did achieve pretty nice zooming, right?",
    "Here.",
    "But as we zoom in, still you get digital art, right?",
    "So yeah, to answer a question of whether we can indefinitely zoom, it feels like we can't.",
    "Really zoom out indefinitely."
  ],
  "46:50": [
    "Let's actually give it a try.",
    "So let's see what this thing generated.",
    "And play around a little bit with Leonardo AI and Magnific.",
    "Okay, so what picture do we want to play around?",
    "What, which one of them looks interesting?",
    "I think I like this.",
    "Maybe this.",
    "I think this could be fun.",
    "Let's try this.",
    "So let me show you Leonardo.",
    "So this is Leonardo.",
    "They have a lot of tools today.",
    "I want to focus on what they have called a canvas editor.",
    "They do have all kinds of like real time canvas, which is kind of fun way to draft something",
    "quick, because they are changing stuff very quickly.",
    "You can like do some kind of collage in here and so on.",
    "They have image to image.",
    "They have real time generation dingy and so on, so on, so on stuff around motions, textures"
  ],
  "47:72": [
    "and actually have a new bit of upscale.",
    "Actually let's give it a try quickly.",
    "Let's go add an image.",
    "Let's add an image and check.",
    "So here is an image.",
    "And now.",
    "Okay, let's upscale.",
    "Looks kind of similar to how a magnificent works.",
    "Let's take a look."
  ],
  "48:42": [
    "Anyways, while it's working, let's actually go and work with canvas, because this canvas",
    "is what we came here for.",
    "It's a little bit glitchy for me, but so I want to add an image from computer.",
    "We have this image.",
    "It's a little bit glitchy where I actually want to go to the center of the canvas or",
    "somewhere else, which for me a little bit.",
    "So I need to put option alt C to zoom in back.",
    "So I had some stuff I was playing here before.",
    "Let's delete.",
    "It has text.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So let's experiment with editing.",
    "So we have this kind of thingy.",
    "So how do you edit?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Okay, so let's try to add a rocket here instead.",
    "So I would erase this thing.",
    "I would probably scale it so that we focus only on the thing we will be feeling.",
    "We can choose here on the right image to image.",
    "If you have image to image, it completely reimagines it, or we actually want inpainting",
    "outpainting, which inpainting outpainting will try to use surrounding of the thing we",
    "erased and the prompt we've write down here to fill it in with whatever we asked for.",
    "And I want, there is actually a bunch of models you can use, bunch of settings and so on and",
    "so on.",
    "So we want the rocket.",
    "So a rocket, like a cartoony rocket, flying among balloons.",
    "Okay, not flying.",
    "Flying up, lifting up, among balloons.",
    "Let's try.",
    "So this is the way I was adding the clock where I want it.",
    "So I generate a picture with Dali or Majorny.",
    "I find areas where I want to be, like, that I more or less like for a topic and then I",
    "edit it with this.",
    "And it doesn't work exactly.",
    "I think the prompt was bad.",
    "It's actually showing me a rocket on a balloon.",
    "Let's actually just say cartoony rocket lifting up.",
    "So it tried to do a balloon with rocket on top.",
    "That didn't look good at all.",
    "Let's see if it can do it.",
    "I have no idea what the hell.",
    "I guess this is a rocket.",
    "It's weird.",
    "So filling in.",
    "I guess the rocket in this case is too much for it.",
    "One thing one can do also is to put a rocket on top and do in image to image as well.",
    "And I did more.",
    "So it's not straight forward.",
    "My case with clocks.",
    "Let's also try a different model.",
    "So we tried this.",
    "Let's try.",
    "Stable diffusion.",
    "One, two, four.",
    "See how that performs.",
    "So they have a lot of fine-tuned stable diffusion models for different use cases.",
    "So it's not very straight forward.",
    "Depending on what you're trying to do.",
    "Oh, actually this time there is something rocket-like.",
    "But slightly not in style.",
    "Let's try another model.",
    "So we have a Leonardo, diffusion Excel.",
    "Team shape.",
    "Let's try absolute reality.",
    "So this is just to show you how it really works.",
    "In a sense that sometimes you do spend time trying different things, trying to edit more,",
    "less, erase, maybe do image to image.",
    "So it's not superb in this sense.",
    "But still it's probably one of the best tools in the market yet.",
    "Except for maybe that Photoshop is better, but I mean Photoshop is paid.",
    "This is what you get for free.",
    "Okay, guess this is gonna do."
  ],
  "53:79": [
    "Okay, let's take a look at Upskiller.",
    "It's actually not bad.",
    "Let's close that.",
    "Let's zoom in.",
    "It's actually not bad.",
    "Better, I guess, like, so which I think is still better.",
    "We can actually compare.",
    "So I think it's still better, but it definitely does it thing.",
    "Let's try Magnific.",
    "Not bad.",
    "What's interesting for me, can we actually zoom in even more?",
    "So what's interesting for me for crazy use cases, let's download it.",
    "Let's go here.",
    "Let's zoom in onto the balloon.",
    "Let's take a screenshot of a balloon.",
    "Let's ask it to upscale once more, but balloon.",
    "And see what the hell's happening.",
    "What's gonna happen?",
    "So here we have a picture of a balloon uploading and we want to upscale it.",
    "Let's go.",
    "This upscaler is actually kind of expensive.",
    "It's 30 coins.",
    "So you can only do five this kind of upscales for free per day.",
    "Well it does that.",
    "Let's actually go and play with Magnific.",
    "So this is Magnific.",
    "You can, they actually added style transfer.",
    "I will not go into this today, but they have upscale thingy.",
    "Let's for now upscale the image from Dali and compare how it upscales.",
    "We can also say that we want Forex and I will not change anything else.",
    "So it's upscaling.",
    "How things are going here.",
    "Did I press?",
    "So I think here it definitely does it better.",
    "But you can also see that it's getting weirder as you zoom in and zoom in.",
    "But I don't like it still.",
    "It does do it job better.",
    "Honestly, it's almost there to have like I don't know.",
    "Imagine traveling through picture.",
    "Zooming in the area and it's upscaling and you like travel.",
    "Getting closer and closer to this.",
    "And you can probably also effect it with prompt a bit.",
    "Not bad.",
    "It's actually not bad.",
    "So maybe one doesn't need as much.",
    "Magnific is slow, but we will see if it's better or not.",
    "It will be interesting to compare.",
    "Yeah, Magnific is slow for big pictures.",
    "You can actually try.",
    "Let's actually try to continue this thing.",
    "So let's open this.",
    "Let's zoom in and to Gandola.",
    "Let's take a screenshot of Gandola.",
    "Let's close it.",
    "Let's go here.",
    "So one cool thing about it.",
    "It's weird that your UI is glitchy.",
    "Okay, let's do it.",
    "Okay, now it.",
    "Okay, let's take Gandola.",
    "Let's upscale that.",
    "Oh, this is ready.",
    "So it's a little bit hard to see in web, like in web interface, what it did.",
    "So let's download and compare.",
    "So here is a picture from Magnific.",
    "Here is a picture from the Leonardo EI.",
    "So in Leonardo EI, we already checked.",
    "Let's actually zoom in on the same area.",
    "Let's zoom in on the balloon.",
    "So this is balloon in Leonardo, and it was faster, and I think it's actually cheaper.",
    "So this is balloon.",
    "Let's zoom in on the balloon in Magnific.",
    "So this or this?",
    "Magnific definitely crisper.",
    "But at the same time, I kind of like more what it did.",
    "It pictures the Leonardo.",
    "I think Leonardo stays closer to original picture.",
    "Magnific is way more creative in this sense.",
    "So I actually don't know.",
    "I kind of like Leonardo.",
    "It's interesting that they released this.",
    "Okay, what do we want to zoom?",
    "So one interesting thing actually that Magnific does does well, better than Leonardo it seems,",
    "is that let's actually zoom in to Kimiseko.",
    "One thing that it does humans well.",
    "So let's actually zoom in again, scroll down, and here is a person.",
    "Let's see what Leonardo does.",
    "This person looking good in Leonardo.",
    "Oh.",
    "I would say it's not like, okay.",
    "So again, Magnific is more crisper, but it's also more expensive and takes longer.",
    "I wonder if I would upscale this.",
    "But I think it looks not bad.",
    "I think I would play more with Leonardo.",
    "It's actually interesting.",
    "It's not bad.",
    "Okay.",
