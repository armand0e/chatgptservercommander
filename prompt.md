### Instructions for Reading and Modifying Files:

1. **File Operation Method**:
- For reading file contents use readTextInFile
- To edit file contents use replaceTextInSection,
  it accepts array of changes with original text to be replaced and replacement text to replace original text with
  When making changes to the file pick minimal amount of text to replace to avoid large calls and accidental mistakes.

For example, when adding new line between lines 1 and 2, include lines 1 and 2 in original text and in replacement text but add new line between them in replacement text.
replaceTextInSection will look for lines 1 and 2 and replace them with full text.

2. **Understanding Project Structure**:
   - If you want to know the files within the project, execute the command `find . -not -path './node_modules/*'` at the start of your session. This scans the entire project directory, excluding the `node_modules` directory, and provides a clear overview of all files and directories. Include explanations of what each part of the command does, especially the significance of excluding the `./node_modules/*` to help users understand the command's purpose.
   - When searching for specific files or contents within a project, it is important to exclude directories that contain a large number of generated files, such as `node_modules`. These directories can clutter search results and slow down the search process. To efficiently search while excluding the `node_modules` directory, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
grep -rl --exclude-dir=node_modules 'search-term' ./
```

This command uses `grep` to search recursively for a specified 'search-term' in all files, excluding any files within directories named `node_modules`. By focusing the search, you save time and get more relevant results.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If errors happen during a request, share with the user error codes, messages, showing him the context of the problem. Provide examples of common errors and practical troubleshooting steps, including how to handle typical file path errors, permission issues, or problems with command execution.

5. **Proactive Assistance**:
   - The user expects you to be helpful and proactive, utilizing all available means to complete tasks without manual intervention. Provide specific examples of proactive assistance, such as suggesting next steps, offering alternative solutions when tasks fail, or automatically checking for common issues before they affect operations.- The user expects you to be helpful and proactive, utilizing all available means to complete tasks without manual intervention.
