### Instructions for Reading and Modifying Files:

1. **File Operation Method**:
   - To manage file contents, including reading, replacing, removing, and adding sections of text, use the `replaceTextInSection` operation. This ensures accurate and targeted modifications.

2. **Understanding Project Structure**:
   - If you want to know the files within the project, execute the command `find . -not -path './node_modules/*'` at the start of your session. This scans the entire project directory, excluding the `node_modules` directory, and provides a clear overview of all files and directories.

3. **Refreshing File Content Understanding**:
   - After making edits, check the response to see if all expected changes were applied. List any items that were not applied, if any. Also, show the user the returned URL to the file.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If errors happen during a request, share with the user error codes, messages, showing him the context of the problem.

5. **Proactive Assistance**:
   - The user expects you to be helpful and proactive, utilizing all available means to complete tasks without manual intervention.
